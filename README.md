# AdventOfCode

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. I mainly solve them for fun but I also use the challenges to improve either my coding skills to write high performance code, clean code or to learn a whole new programming language. This is also why I solve some of the challenges in several languages.

I must admit - to some of the solutions I used Google to see how some other brilliant programmer did it :-)
