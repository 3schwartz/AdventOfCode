# AdventOfCode

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

I mainly solve them for fun, but I also use the challenges to improve my coding skills either to write high performance code, clean code or to learn a whole new programming language. This is also why I solve some of the challenges in several languages.
